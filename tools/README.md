## TFBoost tools

The tools present in this folder are ROOT macros used to produce toy examples of transient signals in 3D sensors, in particular ideal 3D sensor with 2 electrodes at fixed distance, assuming saturated drift velocity for both charged carriers. The macro allows to make a deposit with random internal direction and saves the induced currents at different z position.

To run the macro open a terminal and run the following command:
```bash
root -l currents.c 
```
