### Description
In this directory you can find the transfer functions to be used to perform the digitization. We remind you the following formulas:
$`H(s) = \frac{R_f}{((1+ \tau_f s) * (1 + \tau_r s))}, `$
with $`\tau_f = R_f C_f `$ , rise time constant $`\tau_r = \frac{C_{det} * C_{out}}{g_m * C_f} `$.
